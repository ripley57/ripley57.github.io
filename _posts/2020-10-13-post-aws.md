* "Availability Zones": Goups of isolated data centers, called availability zones, within a geographical region.
* "CloudWatch": Monitoring the health of virtual machines and triggering recovery automatically if needed.
* "CloudFormation": AWS CloudFormation translates the templates into API (HTTP) calls.
* IAM (Identity and Access Management service):
  * An **IAM user** is used to authenticate people accessing your AWS account.  
  * An **IAM group** is a collection of IAM users.  Groups canâ€™t be used to authenticate, but they centralize authorization (e.g. if you want to stop your admin users from terminating EC2 instances, you only need to change the policy for the group instead of changing it for all admin users). 
  * An **IAM role** is used to authenticate AWS resources, for example an EC2 instance. When using an IAM role, your access keys are injected into your EC2 instance automatically. By default, no role is attached to an EC2 instance and therefore the EC2 instance is not allowed to make any calls to the AWS API. To attach an inline role (i.e. not a "managed-role") to an instance, you must first create an **instance profile**.
  * An **IAM policy** is used to define the permissions for a user, group, or role. IAM users and IAM roles use policies for authorization.
